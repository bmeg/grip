# Connect to an existing SQL database

Note: This driver is being superseded by the [GRIPPER engine]({{< ref "../gripper/gripper.md" >}})

GRIP supports modeling an existing SQL database as a graph. GRIP has been tested against [PostgreSQL][psql], but should  work with
[MySQL][sql] (4.1+) and [MariaDB][maria].

Since GRIP uses Go's `database/sql` package, we could (in thoery) support any SQL databases listed on:
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers. Open an [issue](https://github.com/bmeg/grip/issues/new) if you
would like to request support for your favorite SQL database.

## Configuration Notes

* `DataSourceName` is a driver-specific data source name, usually consisting of at least a database name and connection information. Here are links for
to documentation for this field for each supported driver:

  * PostgreSQL - https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters
  * MySQL, Mariadb - https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/#dsn-data-source-name

* `Driver` should be one of: `postgres` or `mysql` (for MySQL or MariaDB).

* `Graphs` is a list of graphs you want to define using the existing tables in the database. For each entry:

  * `Graph` is the name of the graph you want to define
  * `Vertices` is a list of entries, each of which binds a table to a vertex `label` and defines which field in the table to use as the `gid`.
  The remaining columns in the table are treated as the `data` associated with the vertex.
  * `Edges` is a list of entries. Edge entries may be associate an edge `label` with a table, but they are not required to.
  See below for examples of both types of edge definitions.

## Example

Given the following example database: https://github.com/bmeg/grip/blob/master/test/resources/postgres_smtest_data.dump

Load this dump file into your own postgres instance by running:

```bash
createdb --host localhost --port 15432 -U postgres smtest
psql --host localhost --port 15432 -U postgres smtest < postgres_smtest_data.dump
```

GRIP Configuration:

```yaml
