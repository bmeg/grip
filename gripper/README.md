# GRIPPER
## GRIP Plugin External Resources

GRIP Plugin External Resources (GRIPPERs) are GRIP drivers that take external
resources and allow GRIP to access them are part of a unified graph.
To integrate new resources into the graph, you
first deploy griper proxies that plug into the external resources. They are unique
and configured to access specific resources. These provide a view into external
resources as a series of document collections. For example, an SQL gripper would
plug into an SQL server and provide the tables as a set of collections with each
every row a document. A gripper is written as a gRPC server.

## GRIPPER versioning

The Plugin External Resource (PER) is version Alpha 1. As an alpha system,
the plugin interface works, but the API will change and there is no expectation
of continued support for older alpha APIs.

## GRIPPER proxy

With the external resources normalized to a single data model, the graph model
describes how to connect the set of collections into a graph model. Each GRIPPER
is required to provide a GRPC interface that allows access to collections stored
in the resource.

The required functions include:

```
rpc GetCollections(Empty) returns (stream Collection);
```
`GetCollections` returns a list of all of the Collections accessible via this server.

```
rpc GetCollectionInfo(Collection) returns (CollectionInfo);
```
`GetCollectionInfo` provides information, such as the list of indexed fields, in a collection.

```
rpc GetIDs(Collection) returns (stream RowID);
```
`GetIDs` returns a stream of all of the IDs found in a collection.

```
rpc GetRows(Collection) returns (stream Row);
```
`GetRows` returns a stream of all of the rows in a collection.

```
rpc GetRowsByID(stream RowRequest) returns (stream Row);
```
`GetRowsByID` accepts a stream of row requests, each one requesting a single row
by it's id, and then returns a stream of results.

```
rpc GetRowsByField(FieldRequest) returns (stream Row);
```
`GetRowsByField` searches a collection, looking for values found in an indexed field.

## Graph Model

The graph model describes how GRIP will access multiple gripper servers. The graph
is described using three sections, `sources`, `vertices` and `edges`.

The `sources` section describes all of the GRIPPER resources that GRIP will use
to build the graph. The `vertices` section describes how different collections
found in these sources will be turned into Vertex found in the graph. Finally, the
`edges` section describes the different kinds of rules that can be used build the
edges in the graph.

Edges can be built from two rules `fieldToField` and `edgeTable`. In `fieldToField`,
a field value found in one vertex can be used to look up matching destination vertices
by using an indexed field found in another collection that has been mapped to a vertex.
For `edgeTable` connections, there is a single collection that represents a connection between
two other collections that have been mapped to vertices.
